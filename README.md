Offline AI Chatbot with Advanced Memory, Retrieval, and Adaptation  
------------------------------------------------------------------

This project showcases a fully offline, end-to-end conversational agent built on the Falcon-7B-Instruct language model, extended with LoRA adapters for lightweight fine-tuning. Designed to run without Internet connectivity, the chatbot combines on-device neural retrieval, dynamic memory management, and robust hallucination monitoring to deliver accurate, contextually grounded responses in real time.

Key Features  
- LoRA-Powered Adaptation: By fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the model achieves specialized conversational behavior with minimal storage and compute overhead.  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): An on-device FAISS index of domain documents enriches every answer with relevant background knowledge, ensuring factual accuracy and depth.  
- Dynamic Memory Summarization: Long conversation histories are automatically condensed into concise summaries once a configurable token threshold is reached, keeping prompts performant without losing critical context.  
- Long-Term Memory Bank: The chatbot extracts and stores user preferences and personal details over multiple sessions. These memories are re-injected into prompts when relevant, creating a truly personalized experience.  
- Few-Shot Prompt Engineering: A rotating set of curated example exchanges stabilizes responses and jump-starts reasoning on new topics, even when the prompt is sparse.  
- Hallucination Monitoring & Content Filtering: A zero-shot classifier flags and suppresses contradictions or inappropriate content, ensuring safe, trustworthy outputs at scale.

Under the hood, the system orchestrates multiple lightweight pipelines: a float-16 Falcon model for generation, CPU-hosted summarization and classification, and a Sentence-Transformer encoder for both document retrieval and memory indexing. This modular architecture guarantees efficient GPU utilization, prevents out-of-memory errors, and enables seamless deployment on a single consumer workstation.

Whether you’re exploring on-device AI, building privacy-focused assistants, or experimental memory-augmented NLP, this codebase delivers a blueprint for a next-generation offline chatbot—highly customizable, resource-efficient, and ready to integrate into any user-centric application.
